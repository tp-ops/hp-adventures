# first time in Hogwarts Castle you get intro about the greatest wizards (maybe at this point you have to choose a house)
# after intro you get an overview of progress, this will be shown everytime afterwards
# at some point you unlock level 2 - You know Who, you learn about voldermort
# at some point you unlock level 3 - Dark Magic, you learn about some dark magic
# at some point you unlock level 4 - Horcrux overview, you learn about horcruxes

#for simplicity each level get its own mode. 
#Eacht new level increase magnet difficulty, first level it done for you, second level you dont have to catch but shoot self, last level you have to catch also.

# hit door to lit
# hit again and let magnet grap the ball
# when grabbed open will be opened
# when shot is made the door will closed
# when missed door will be left open until shot is made
# reset shot
